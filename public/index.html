            <li>
               <p>Nick grew up in Rockwall, TX and played trumpet in the high school band and programmed in Java as a hobby. He went to college at the University of Texas at Dallas where he played video games and worked in a laser laboratory. He obtained his bachelor of science in electrical engineering in December 2015. After searching for a long time, he ended up at Oncor Electric Delivery where he began in the billing department and learned how large corporations functioned. He developed his technical skills from his programming days and learned enough to become a data analyst in the company, where he honed his technical and business skills and learned how collaborative projects are managed. He took some time off work to figure things out, and now he is learning skills and working on projects to become a software developer for back end applications.</p>
